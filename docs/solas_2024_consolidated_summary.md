## 1. Structure and Applicability – Foundation for the Convention
- **Scope and exclusions:** Passenger and cargo ships on international voyages; exclusions for warships, wooden primitive craft, small private pleasure craft, and domestic vessels unless flagged through local legislation. Offshore units, special purpose ships, and fishing vessels may fall under SOLAS when cross-referenced through other IMO codes or flag instructions.
- **Hierarchy of instruments:** SOLAS articles, annex chapters, mandatory codes (LSA, FSS, HSC, SPS, Polar Code, ISM/ISPS), and recognized performance standards; interpretation often guided by IMO circulars and MSC resolutions.
- **Equivalents and alternative designs:** Formal safety assessment and engineering analysis required; human factors, maintenance programs, and crew training must demonstrate equal safety. Approval conditions, risk controls, and operational limitations are recorded in the Ship Safety Construction File and the SMS.
- **Exemptions and dispensations:** Granted by flag with explicit validity and operating limits (voyage area, season, cargo, crew competency). Temporary dispensations demand mitigation measures and PSC notification.
- **Surveys and harmonization:** Alignment with the Harmonized System of Survey and Certification (HSSC); annual, intermediate, and renewal surveys linked to certificate validity windows. In-water survey acceptance, bottom inspection intervals, and RO participation must follow flag policy.
- **Certification suite:** Passenger Ship Safety, Cargo Ship Safety Construction/Equipment/Radio, High-Speed Craft Safety, Polar Ship Certificate, International Load Line, International Tonnage, Document of Compliance/Safety Management Certificate, International Ship Security Certificate, Continuous Synopsis Record, and class/statutory endorsements.
- **Flag and port interaction:** Flag issues and endorses; RO conducts delegated work under agreement; PSC applies risk-based targeting and may detain for serious non-conformities. PSC inspection history influences future targeting.
- **Records and transparency:** Mandatory carriage of plans (fire control, lifesaving arrangements, stability), operating manuals, and logbooks; electronic records permitted with tamper-evident controls and secure backups.
- **Interpretation and circular tracking:** Maintain a register of IMO/flag circulars that affect operational chapters (e.g., lifeboat release gear safeguards, enclosed space entry). Record how each circular is implemented on board and whether it triggers equipment retrofit or procedure changes.
- **Jurisdictional layering:** Document any coastal state requirements that exceed SOLAS (e.g., additional passenger accounting rules, pilotage escorts, emission control cross-references) and connect them to voyage-specific checklists. Capture bilateral agreements for Arctic/Antarctic voyages that affect SAR coverage.
- **Ownership/management transitions:** Detail handover procedures for DOC/SMC, insurance, and statutory certificates when ownership changes; include CSR continuity and digital key custody for electronic certificates. Maintain gap analyses when ships change class societies or ROs.
- **Evidence expectations for audits:** Prepare sampled voyage plans, maintenance history, and drill debriefs as demonstration packs for PSC or flag audits. Include mapping that shows which SOLAS provisions are fulfilled by which SMS procedures and which planned maintenance routines provide objective evidence.

## 2. Chapter I – General Provisions and Surveys (Equivalent in depth to full prior summary)
- **Applicability triggers:** New-build vs. existing ship requirements; retroactive application for critical safety upgrades (e.g., on-load release gear, fixed gas systems safeguards). Change-of-trade or conversion may trigger re-survey and partial new-build standards.
- **Survey structure:**
  - **Annual:** General condition, equipment functionality, certificate validity, and corrective action follow-up.
